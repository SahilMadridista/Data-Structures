Two types of methods in the Doubly ended queue. 

1) Returns null or false if something is wrong.

	offerFirst(e)
	pollFirst()
	peerFirst()
	offerLast()
	pollLast()
	peekLast()

2) Exception throwing methods

	addFirst(e)
	removeFirst()
	getFirst()
	addLast()
	removeLast()
	getLast()4
	

Note ----> If we are using addFirst tehn it'll add the first element at the first and again 
	if addFirst is used, it will place the second element at first and shifts the previous 
	element to second place.
	
Node ----> addFirst and push works the same. Both the functions add the value at the front of the
	array deque.
